# signald - An (unofficial) Signal Daemon


signald is a daemon that facilitates communication over Signal.


## Installation

 - [From source](./docs/install/source.md)
 - [Debian](./docs/install/debian.md)
 - [Docker](./docs/install/docker.md)

## Quick Start

1. Startup signald depending on your installation method
1. In a second terminal window, connect to the signald control socket: `nc -U /var/run/signald/signald.sock` (Debian users will need to have `netcat-openbsd` installed)
1. Register a new number on signal by typing this: `{"type": "register", "username": "+12024561414"}` (replace `+12024561414` with your own number)
1. Once you receive the verification text, submit it like this: `{"type": "verify", "username": "+12024561414", "code": "000-000"}` where `000-000` is the verification code.
1. Incoming messages will be sent to the socket and shown on your screen. To send a message, use something like this:

```json
{"type": "send", "username": "+12024561414", "recipientNumber": "+14235290302", "messageBody": "Hello, Dave"}
```

## Contributing/Feedback/Bugs
[Issues and MRs are accepted via GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/thefinn93/signald). There is an IRC channel, `#signald` on Freenode,
for those that go for that sort of thing. MRs gladly accepted.


## Stability
This is currently beta software. The public API may have backwards-incompatible, breaking changes before it stabilizes, although we will make an
effort to not do that. Further, there are no guarantees of safety or security with this software.

Breaking changes that have been made:
* As of [!86](https://git.callpipe.com/finn/signald/merge_requests/68), the data folder has moved from `~/.config/signal` to `~/.config/signald`.
  You will need to migrate your data manually, unless you're using the debian package, which should handle this automatically.
* As of [!66](https://git.callpipe.com/finn/signald/merge_requests/66), JSON keys that previously had values of `null` will simply not be sent.

## Interacting with signald

### Use a library
signald's protocol can be somewhat annoying to interact with, and several libraries are available to assist with that:

* Python:
  * [pysignald](https://pypi.org/project/pysignald/) - a third party signald library in python
  * [Janky Signal Bot Framework](https://github.com/JankySolutions/SignalBotFramework) - a janky framework for writing simple call and response bots
* Go:
  * [signald-go](https://git.callpipe.com/finn/signald-go) - a signald library in go

### Write a library
When started, signald will create a unix socket at `/var/run/signald/signald.sock` (can be overridden on the command line).
To interact with it, connect to that socket and send new line (`\n`) terminated JSON strings. The specific protocol is described below.

## Socket protocol.
Each message sent to the control socket must be valid JSON and have a `type` field. The possible message types and their
arguments are enumerated below. All messages may optionally include an `id` field. When signald follows up on a previous
command, it will include the same `id` value. Most commands (but not all) require `username` field, which is the number
to use for this action, as multiple numbers can be registered with signald at the same time.

### `send`
Sends a signal message to another user or a group. Possible values are:

| Field | Type | Required? | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `username` | string | yes | The signal number you are sending *from*. |
| `recipientNumber` | string | no | The number you are sending to. Required if not sending to a group |
| `recipientGroupId` | string | no | The base64 encoded group ID to send to. Required if sending to a group |
| `messageBody` | string | no | The text of the message. |

## Transition An Account From signal-cli

signald's on-disk data structures are generally the same as or very similar to signal-cli's. Until recently, signald used the same
location to store the accounts on the disk. To transition all of your accounts from signal-cli to signald, simply rename `~/.config/signal`
to `~/.config/signald`. Please note that you should **not** copy and use the same account with both programs. Link them to the same user
if you would like to use both signald and signal-cli.

If you have installed the `.deb` and are using the system-wide signald service, copy to `/var/lib/signald`

## Contributing
I would like to get this to the point that anything one can do in the signal app can also be done via signald. There should be open issues for all missing features. If you have a feature you want feel free to work on it and submit a pull request. If you don't want to work on it, follow the relevant issue and get notified when there is progress.
