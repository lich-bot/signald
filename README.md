# signald - An (unofficial) Signal Daemon


signald is a daemon that facilitates communication over Signal.  It is unofficial, unapproved, and [not nearly as secure as the real Signal clients](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/issues/101).

Most of this information presented here, as well as a lot more, is also available on [signald.org](https://signald.org).

## Contributing/Questions/Feedback/Bugs

[Issues and MRs are accepted via GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald). There is also an [IRC/matrix channel](https://signald.org/articles/IRC/).
if you have a question, open an issue or come by the channel. Some aspects of signald aren't well documented, don't be afraid to ask "stupid" questions.

## Interacting with signald

### Use a library
There are several libraries to make it easier to interact with signald from your software:

* Python:
  * [pysignald](https://pypi.org/project/pysignald/) - general purpose signald library
  * [pysignald-async](https://gitlab.com/nicocool84/pysignald-async) - a signald library using modern Python features generated from the API docs
  * [Semaphore](https://github.com/lwesterhof/semaphore) - a simple (rule-based) bot library for Signal Private Messenger in Python
* Go:
  * [signald-go](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald-go) - a signald library in go

### Write a library
When started, signald will create a unix socket at `/var/run/signald/signald.sock` (can be overridden on the command line).
To interact with it, connect to that socket and send new line (`\n`) terminated JSON strings. The specific protocol is described below.

### Manually
This is useful for debugging mostly. consider using [signaldctl](https://signald.org/signaldctl/) for one off interactions.

To manually type the signald protocol, install a version of netcat that supports connecting to unix sockets (`-U`). On Debian,
the package is called `netcat-openbsd`. Connect to the signald control socket with netcat `nc -U /var/run/signald/signald.sock`.
Type JSON requests on a single line and hit enter to send them.

## Socket protocol.
Each message sent to the socket must be valid JSON and have a `type` field and `version` field. messages may optionally
include an `id` field which will be sent back in the response ([more info](https://signald.org/articles/request-ids/)).
Most requests (but not all) require an `account` or `username` field, which is the phone number to use for the action as
multiple accounts (multiple numbers) can be registered to a single signald instance. The phone number must be in
[E.164](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) format starting with a `+` character.

Below are mostly legacy (`v0`) requests. New versions have been introduced, sometimes with added functionality. See
[Protocol Versioning](https://signald.org/articles/protocol-versioning/) for more information. The new protocol is fully
documented on [signald.org](https://signald.org/), which is automatically re-generated when signald is updated.

**all v0 requests are deprecated and will be removed at the end of 2021**
