# signald - An (unofficial) Signal Daemon


signald is a daemon that facilitates communication over Signal.  Unofficial, unapproved, and [not nearly as secure as the real Signal clients](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/issues/101).


## Installation

 - [From source](./docs/install/source.md)
 - [Debian](./docs/install/debian.md)
 - [Docker](./docs/install/docker.md)

## signald clients
* [libpurple](https://github.com/hoehermann/libpurple-signald)
* [matrix](https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-signal)

## other things that use signald
note that this list does not include libraries, which are listed under [lower down](#use-a-library).

* [Adhesive](https://github.com/signalstickers/Adhesive) - A chatbot serving as your glue between Telegram and Signal sticker packs
* [alertmanager-webhook-signald](https://github.com/dgl/alertmanager-webhook-signald) -  Alertmanager webhook server for Signald 

## Quick Start for developers

### Launch signald
1. Startup signald depending on your installation method
1. In a second terminal window, connect to the signald control socket: `nc -U /var/run/signald/signald.sock` (Debian users will need to have `netcat-openbsd` installed)
1. Responses from signald, including incoming Signal messages, will be sent to the socket and shown on your screen

### Connect an account to Signal
Either register a new number on Signal or add signald as a linked device on your existing Signal account.

#### To register a new number:
1. Send something like: `{"type": "register", "username": "+12024561414"}`
1. Once you receive the verification text, submit it like this: `{"type": "verify", "username": "+12024561414", "code": "000-000"}` where `000-000` is the verification code.

#### To link an account:
1. Send `{"type": "link", "deviceName": "your-device-name"}`
1. You'll receive a `uri`, create a QR code from that URI
1. Open the Signal app, go to Settings -> Linked Devices, tap the + button in the bottom right and scan the QR code.

### Interact with Signal
- To subscribe to messages being sent to you, use (where username is *your* number):
```json
{"type": "subscribe", "username": "+12024561414"}
```

- To send a message, use something like this:
```json
{"type": "send", "username": "+12024561414", "recipientAddress": {"number": "+14235290302"}, "messageBody": "Hello, Dave"}
```

## Contributing/Feedback/Bugs
[Issues and MRs are accepted via GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald). There is an IRC channel, `#signald` on Freenode,
for those that go for that sort of thing. MRs gladly accepted.

## Stability
This is currently beta software. The public API may have backwards-incompatible, breaking changes before it stabilizes, although we will make an
effort to not do that. Further, there are no guarantees of safety or security with this software.

## Interacting with signald

### Use a library
signald's protocol can be somewhat annoying to interact with, and several libraries are available to assist with that:

* Python:
  * [pysignald](https://pypi.org/project/pysignald/) - general purpose signald library
  * [Semaphore](https://github.com/lwesterhof/semaphore) - a simple (rule-based) bot library for Signal Private Messenger in Python
* Go:
  * [signald-go](https://git.callpipe.com/finn/signald-go) - a signald library in go

### Write a library
When started, signald will create a unix socket at `/var/run/signald/signald.sock` (can be overridden on the command line).
To interact with it, connect to that socket and send new line (`\n`) terminated JSON strings. The specific protocol is described below.

## Socket protocol.
Each message sent to the control socket must be valid JSON and have a `type` field. The possible message types and their
arguments are enumerated below. All messages may optionally include an `id` field. When signald follows up on a previous
command, it will include the same `id` value. Most commands (but not all) require `username` field, which is the number
to use for this action, as multiple numbers can be registered with signald at the same time.

### `send`

| Field | Type | Required? | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `username` | string | yes | The signal number you are sending *from*. |
